This module is for designing polycubes stuff using SAT-assembly
As such it requires a bunch of additional packages that aren't included in the main Pypatchy dependancies
## Dependancies
### PySAT
Python SAT solver library
Install with `python -m pip install 'python-sat[pblib,aiger]'`
### The TLM
Polycubes library with temperature

Go to directory `cpp`, follow installation instructions
